The Contractor shall be solely responsible for any delays resulting from failure \non its part to provide the Documentation within the times specified. \n \nE.13.3. \nMIMOS shall be allowed to reproduce strictly for its own use and for the avoidance of doubt \nincluding the use by its agents and contractors all Documentation including without \nlimitation handbooks, manuals and drawings of the Equipment and Software for training, \ninstallation, operation and maintenance requirements. To the extent that the Documentation \nconstitutes Confidential Information, the Documentation shall be subject to confidentiality \nprovisions in Clause C.11. \n \nE.13.4. \nUpon request of MIMOS, the Contractor shall at no additional cost supply detailed \ninformation on the principles and functions of the Software and shall describe clearly the \ninteraction of the Software with the Equipment and the procedures to ensure the continued \nsatisfactory operation of the System. \n \nE.13.5. \nNotwithstanding delivery of any part of the System, Equipment or the Software, the \nContractor shall retain copies of all Documentation relating to the System, Equipment or \nSoftware concerned during the Life Span of the System to enable the Contractor to supply \nany replacement parts and/or modifications to the System, Equipment or Software should \nthese subsequently be required. \n \nE.13.6. \nThe Contractor hereby assigns to MIMOS, by way of assignment of present and future \nrights, all rights of copyright and all other Intellectual Property Rights in all Documentation \nor other works created for MIMOS under this Contract.  The copyright and other Intellectual \nProperty Rights which are pre-existing in any of the Documentation or belonging to any third \nparty shall remain the property of the Contractor or such third party, but, the Contractor \nshall grant or procure to be granted to MIMOS a perpetual, non-exclusive, royalty free \n\n\n1.6.2013 \n- E12 - \n \nlicense to use that Documentation world-wide for all reasonable purposes in connection \nwith the use, assembly, operation and repair of the Equipment and Software and their \nintegration within the System. \n \nE.13.7. \nAny apparent omission, inconsistency or ambiguity in detail and/or description in any of the \nDocumentation may be referred by MIMOS to the Contractor for clarification and, in that \ncase, shall (if necessary) be rectified by the Contractor within seven (7) days of such \nreferral. \n \nE.13.8. \nThe Contractor shall, without cost to MIMOS, forthwith on request by MIMOS, execute all \nnecessary documents and do all other acts and things reasonably required by MIMOS to \nperfect and record MIMOS's rights to the Documentation as provided in this Contract. \n \nE.13.9. \nThe obligations of the Contractor under the Contract shall not be regarded as complete until \nall Documentation required under this Contract, or as reasonably requested MIMOS, has \nbeen provided.  \n \nE.14. \nDelays and Adjustments Due To Delays \n \nE.14.1. \nIn recognition of the critical time factor in this Contract, the Contractor shall so execute, \nprovide and complete and procure the execution, provision and completion of the works so \nthat each milestone shall be completed within the time specified in the Implementation \nSchedule and the Delivery and/or Commissioning of the Equipment and/or Software is \ncompleted by the respective Scheduled Completion Dates, subject to any extensions \nexpressly permitted pursuant to this Contract. \n \nE.14.2. \nIf the Contractor at any time knows or has reason to believe that the Actual Completion \nDate will occur later than the Scheduled Completion Date for reasons caused by the \nContractor or its personnel, agents or sub-contractors, the Contractor shall promptly notify \nMIMOS in writing of that fact, of the expected period of delay, the cause of delay and the \nsteps proposed to be taken by the Contractor to minimize the delay. If and to the extent that \na delay has been caused by events of Force Majeure of which prompt notice has been \ngiven hereunder, the Scheduled Completion Date shall be extended in accordance with \nClause C.6.1. \n \nE.14.3. \nIf MIMOS at any time has reason to believe that the Actual Completion Date will occur later \nthan the Scheduled Completion Date for reasons caused by MIMOS or its personnel, \nMIMOS shall promptly notify the Contractor in writing of that fact, of the expected period of \ndelay, the cause of delay and the steps proposed to be taken by MIMOS to minimise the \ndelay. If and to the extent that such delay may have an impact on the Implementation \nSchedule or Scheduled Completion Date, MIMOS shall advise the Contractor of the same \nin writing and the Scheduled Completion Date shall be extended for a period corresponding \nto the duration of such delay. \n \nE.14.4. \nShould the Delivery and/or Commissioning of the Equipment and/or Software be delayed \nfor any reason caused by the Contractor or its personnel, agents or sub-contractors MIMOS \nreserves the right to stipulate that all or part of the Equipment and/or Software so delayed \nshall be air-freighted to the Site if such delay is likely to prejudice the Scheduled Completion \nDate. The Contractor shall bear the costs so incurred. \n \nE.14.5. \nIn the event that the Actual Completion Date occurs later than the Scheduled Completion \nDate as a result of an act or omission of the Contractor or its personnel, agents or sub-\ncontractors and such delay is not caused by a Force Majeure event, the Contract Price shall \nbe reduced as Adjustment Due to Delays for such default, and not as a penalty, calculated \n\n\n1.6.2013 \n- E13 - \n \ncommencing from the Scheduled Completion Date up to such time of completion or \ntermination under Clause E.14.7, at the rate of: \n \nE.14.5.1. \nTwo per cent (2%) per week or part thereof of the Contract Price for the first four \n(4) weeks of delay; and \n \nE.14.5.2. \nFour per cent (4%) per week or part thereof of the Contract Price from the fifth \n(5th) week of delay. \n \nProvided that the Adjustments Due to Delay as stated in this Clause E.14.5 shall not \nexceed twenty per cent (20%) of the Contract Price. \n \nE.14.6. \nThe Parties acknowledge and agree that because of the unique nature of the services \nprovided by the Contractor and the unavailability of substitutes for the services, it is difficult \nor almost impossible to determine with precision the amount of loss and/or damages that \nwould or might be incurred by MIMOS if the Contractor fails to achieve the Scheduled \nCompletion Date.  Consequently, the Contractor and MIMOS have, in good faith, \nestablished the sums set forth in Clause E.14.5 for Adjustments Due to Delay as \nreasonable estimates of the fair and reasonable compensation to which MIMOS would be \nentitled in the event the Contractor fails to achieve the Scheduled Completion Date. \n \nE.14.7. \nIf the Actual Completion Date occurs later than thirty (30) days of the Scheduled \nCompletion Date for the Delivery and/or Commissioning of Equipment and/or Software as a \nresult of an act or omission of the Contractor, its sub-contractor or agents, then \nnotwithstanding any other provision of this Contract and notwithstanding the Adjustment \nDue to Delays  pursuant to Clause E.14.5, MIMOS shall be entitled to forthwith terminate \nthis Contract by giving written notice to the Contractor thereof and to recover from the \nContractor the amount of all damages and loss suffered by MIMOS by reason of such \nfailure. Upon such termination the remedies provided in Clause C.9 shall apply. \n \nE.14.8. \nIf MIMOS becomes entitled to Adjustment Due To Delays pursuant to Clause E.14.5, \nMIMOS may deduct the amount of such damages from any payments which may from time \nto time be due or become due to the Contractor under the Contract, including, without \nlimitation, from the performance bond set out in item 9 of SCHEDULE A. \n \nE.14.9. \nPayment of the Adjustment Due to Delays pursuant to Clause E.14.5 shall not relieve the \nContractor from its obligation to Deliver and/or Commission the Equipment and/or Software \nor from any other liability or obligation under this Contract and shall be without prejudice to \nMIMOS’s other rights under this Contract or at law. \n \nE.15. \nConsequences of termination of the Contract \n \nE.15.1. \nUpon termination of this Contract where SCHEDULE E is applicable, the following shall \napply: \n \nE.15.1.1. \nthe Contractor shall forthwith cease work and remove its personnel or the \npersonnel of its agents or sub-contractors from the Site(s); \n \nE.15.1.2. \nthe Contractor shall not remove from the Sites any Equipment, Software or \nDocumentation whatsoever nor shall the Contractor remove any temporary \nbuildings, tools, goods or materials that are not Equipment or Software provided \nby the Contractor until permission in writing is given by MIMOS; \n \nE.15.1.3. \nMIMOS may at its option elect to either: \n \n\n\n1.6.2013 \n- E14 - \n \nE.15.1.3.1. \ncontinue work either by itself or by sub-contracting to a third party. In \neither case, if the cost incurred by MIMOS in so completing or redoing \nthe works under the terminated Purchase Order is greater than the \namount for such works which would have been payable under the \nterminated Purchase Order, then the Contractor shall pay to MIMOS \nsuch excess amount.  In addition, on demand by MIMOS, the Contractor \nshall forthwith deliver to MIMOS all Equipment, Software and \nDocumentation in any way commenced, partly executed, or completed \nand all materials, plant, tools and implements and all other things on or \nabout any Site which are, in the opinion of MIMOS, necessary for the \nexecution and completion of the works. In such an event, the Contractor \nshall be credited for the value of all such items subject to any liability the \nContractor may have to compensate MIMOS for, or to make good at the \nContractor's expense, any breach, non-performance, neglect or other \nnon-observance of the Purchase Order or the Contract. MIMOS will give \npermission to the Contractor in writing to and the Contractor shall \nremove any Equipment or Software or any such temporary buildings, \ntools, plant, goods or materials MIMOS does not wish to purchase or \nuse; OR \n \nE.15.1.3.2. \nMIMOS shall be entitled to require the Contractor to remove all the \ndelivered Equipment and Software, at the Contractor’s own expense, \nand to refund all monies paid to the Contractor by MIMOS under the \nterminated Purchase Order together with interest at the rate of two \npercent (2%) above the base lending rate of Malayan Banking Berhad, \nhead office in Malaysia. \n \nE.15.1.4. \nIn addition to the remedies provided under above, the Contractor shall pay to \nMIMOS the amount of any other loss and/or damage incurred by MIMOS by \nreason of the breach by the Contractor and termination of the Contract. \n \nE.16. \nTraining \n \nE.16.1. \nThe Contractor undertakes to provide Training to MIMOS according to Appendix E4. Travel \nand living expenses for MIMOS’s personnel undergoing training for the duration of the \ntraining will be borne by MIMOS, unless otherwise agreed in writing. All equipment, \nsoftware, documentation, materials and facilities to be used in connection with the training \nshall be provided by the Contractor at its own cost and expense. \n \nE.16.2. \nThe Training to be provided may, at MIMOS's sole discretion, be accumulated and used at \nsuch time as MIMOS may decide. \n \nE.16.3. \nFor each training course, the Contractor shall provide MIMOS and its designated personnel \nwith copies of all student or other technical materials and manuals relating to:- \n \nE.16.3.1. \nsuch educational or training courses which may be conducted by the Contractor; \n \nE.16.3.2. \nthe System or MIMOS’s anticipated use of the System; and \n \nE.16.3.3. \ntechnical or engineering improvements or changes relevant to the System or any \npart thereof. \n \n \n\n\n1.6.2013 \n- E15 - \n \nE.17. \nInsurance \n \nE.17.1. \nWithout prejudice to the indemnity and obligations set forth in Clause C.8.1 and C.8.2, \nMIMOS shall effect or cause to be effected a Contractors All Risk insurance policy (“CAR \nPolicy”) to cover any works to be carried out for the Commissioning of Equipment and/or \nSoftware. The Contractor will be added as co-insured under the CAR Policy. A copy of the \nCAR Policy may be viewed by the Contractor at MIMOS’s office by appointment. \n \nE.17.2. \nThe CAR Policy shall not cover any plant, machinery, tools, goods, vehicles, property or \narticles belonging to the Contractor, its employees, agents or sub-contractors \n(“Contractor’s Property”) which have been placed at the Site(s) where any works or part \nthereof are being executed. It is expressly agreed that the responsibility and liability for any \nloss and damage to the Contractor’s Property shall remain solely with the Contractor. \n \nE.17.3. \nThe Contractor shall give prompt written notice to MIMOS of any accident or incident \n(whether or not giving rise to a claim under the CAR Policy) as soon as possible but no later \nthan three (3) days after the event. Such notice shall be promptly followed by all necessary \ndocumentation and proper details, and the Contractor shall give its full cooperation to \nMIMOS in respect of such (potential) claims under the CAR policy. \n \nE.17.4. \nThe Contractor shall be liable for all deductibles/excess in respect of any claim under the \nCAR Policy save in circumstances where MIMOS is solely responsible for having caused \nthe loss or damage. The Contractor expressly authorises MIMOS to deduct from any \npayment which may be due to the Contractor, such sums payable to the insurer as \ndeductible/excess and all associated payments. \n \nE.17.5. \nAll monies received in the payment of a claim under the CAR Policy shall be paid to MIMOS \nand MIMOS shall be responsible to administer the same for disbursement towards repairs \nor replacement of the loss or damage to the works or any part thereof. \n \nE.17.6. \nNotwithstanding the procurement of the CAR Policy, the Contractor shall be absolutely and \nsolely responsible for and liable to MIMOS and shall make good all loss or damage to the \nworks that are not recoverable by insurance under the CAR Policy in respect of such loss or \ndamage arising from the acts, omission or negligence of the Contractor or its sub-\ncontractors or agents and/or faulty materials supplied or procured by the Contractor or its \nsub-contractor or agents irrespective of whether the Contractor may be able to claim or \nrecover against any other third party. \n \nE.17.7. \nThe Contractor shall at its own cost and expense procure and maintain for the duration of \nthis Contract professional indemnity insurance covering the breach of its professional duties \nin the performance of works under this Contract, with limits of liability of not less than \nRinggit Malaysia One Million (RM1,000,000) for any single or series of claims arising out of \nor in respect of any negligence, act, omission or error of the Contractor or its personnel. \n \nE.17.8. \nThe Contractor shall ensure that MIMOS is included as a co-insured in the said insurance \npolicy and shall have the benefit of the foregoing insurances. The Contractor shall procure \nthat its insurers shall waive any and all liens and rights of subrogation/recovery against \nMIMOS.

The Change Order procedure set out in \nthis Clause E.18 shall apply to any such change or addition or omission which is requested \nby either Party, and it shall make no difference to these procedures whether it is MIMOS or \nthe Contractor who shall propose such change or addition or omission. \n \nE.18.2. \nIf MIMOS shall require a change or addition to or omission from the Equipment, Software or \nServices it shall notify the Contractor of such requirement in writing specifying in as much \ndetail as MIMOS reasonably believes is practicable the nature of the change or addition to \nor omission it requires and, to the extent known, any other parameters which it considers \ndesirable should apply in relation to such addition, change or omission. \n \nE.18.3. \nIf the Contractor shall consider a change or addition to or omission from the Equipment, \nSoftware or Services it shall make an outline proposal for consideration by MIMOS (which \nMIMOS shall not be obliged to pursue). Such outline proposal shall specify in as much \ndetail as the Contractor reasonably believes is practicable, the nature of the change or \naddition to or omission it requires and state all factors known to the Contractor which \nMIMOS might reasonably consider to be material in deciding whether to request the \nContractor  to develop the proposal further. \n \nE.18.4. \nWithin ten (10) business days (or such other period as may be mutually agreed upon) of: \n \nE.18.4.1. \nreceiving such a notification from MIMOS as is referred to in Clause E.18.2; or \n \nE.18.4.2. \nreceiving a notice from MIMOS indicating that MIMOS wishes to pursue further \nany outline proposal made by the Contractor in a notification as referred to in \nClause E.18.3; \n \nthe Contractor shall inform MIMOS in writing its estimate of all consequential changes to \nthe Equipment, Software or Services or the Implementation Schedule that is reasonably \nnecessary to accommodate such change, addition or omission. In the case of Clause \nE.18.2 the Contractor shall advise MIMOS of the technical feasibility of such a change, \naddition or omission. \n \nE.18.5. \nFor any change requiring additional work by the Contractor, the Contractor will give MIMOS \nin writing the Contractor’s estimate of the cost to MIMOS of the proposed change or \naddition to the Equipment, Software or Services or the changes required to the \nImplementation Schedule. Such quotation shall not be capable of amendment or \nadjustment once accepted. If MIMOS wishes to proceed with the change or addition, it may \ndo so at its option on a fixed price basis (that is accepting the quotation with such \namendments as the Parties may agree) or on a time and materials basis. To the extent that \nany change involves the omission of any item or items from the Equipment, Software or \nServices the Contractor shall provide an estimate of the amount of the reduction in the \n\n\n1.6.2013 \n- E17 - \n \nContract Price which is fair and reasonable in the light of such omission and the consequent \nalteration in the payment schedule. \n \nE.18.6. \nThe proposal, with any revisions which may have been agreed, will be submitted by the \nContractor to MIMOS who shall consider such proposed changes, additions or omissions \nand either: \n \nE.18.6.1. \naccept or confirm the proposed changes or additions to or omissions; \n \nE.18.6.2. \ndecide not to implement the proposed changes or additions to or omission from; \nor \n \nE.18.6.3. \nrequire the proposed changes or additions to or omissions from to be modified (in \nwhich case the contractor shall produce a modified proposal to which Clause \nE.18.4 shall apply). \n \nE.18.7. \nAny changes or additions to or omissions which are agreed pursuant to the above \nprocedures shall be recorded in writing as a Change Order and signed by authorised \nrepresentatives of both Parties within fourteen (14) days of MIMOS giving notice to the \nContractor that it wishes to proceed with the proposal.
